Introduction to Data & Data Science
🌟 What is Data?
Let's assume its a Saturday morning and there is a supermarket e.g Market Square, JustRite, etc near you. Every time you or someone buys a item(s), the supermarket collects information like the product (cornflakes), brand (Nasco), quantity (5 packs), time of the day (10:00 am), cost (#2,500), payment method (transfer), etc. All these small pieces of information are data! At its core, data is simply raw facts, figures, or information collected from observations or measurements. Data can be numbers, words, images, clicks on a website, or even the steps you track on your fitness app!

Imagine the data that is generated from just one point of the contact (the supermarket) for one action (buying) that you performed, now multiply it when you perform several actions (walking, social media usage, watching videos and movies, Bill payments) from different points of contacts (Netflix, Nike Run Club, Facebook, Opay), that's a lot of data points.With over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created every day, we’re in the era of Big Data – a time when businesses and individuals produce tons of data at lightning speed.

📈 Why is Data Important?
Think about all the ways you use data daily: navigating with maps, getting song recommendations, or personalizing your social media feed. Data helps us make informed decisions, uncover trends and patterns, and solve complex problems. In business, using data can mean the difference between making a product that customers love or launching one that flops. For instance, Netflix uses data on viewing habits to suggest shows that keep you binge-watching 🎬📊!

🧠 Why Should You Care About Data Science?
With data flooding in from everywhere, companies need experts to make sense of it all – that’s where Data Science comes in. Data science is the field that combines math, statistics, coding, and domain expertise to extract insights and build predictive models. Data scientists can analyze customer behavior, detect fraud, recommend products, predict stock prices, and so much more. It’s a role that helps shape strategies, innovate products, and, ultimately, drive a company’s success.

Data Science has been ranked as one of the most promising fields of the 21st century. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for data scientists is expected to grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations.

🛠️ The Data Science Process: Your Roadmap
Let’s break down the steps that data scientists typically follow. Each part of this process is relies on the preceding one to convert raw data into valuable insights.

1. Data Collection 📥

Data comes from various sources: surveys, sensors, transactions, social media, and more. For example, Uber collects location data to optimize routes. Without this initial data collection, you have nothing to analyze! How else do you think Spotify Wrapped is created

2. Data Cleaning 🧼

Once we have data, it often needs some serious TLC. Data cleaning is the process of removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting errors. Imagine trying to analyze data with spelling errors or missing information – it would be like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces! A good example of such case is a survey form with options like “N/A” or “Other”. This step ensures that responses make sense for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

Here, data scientists dig into the data to understand its structure and trends. Through visualizations like graphs and charts, we get a sense of patterns, anomalies, or insights. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts observed infection trends through visual graphs, which helped governments make crucial health decisions.

4. Modeling 🤖

This is where the real magic happens! Using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, data scientists create models that can predict outcomes or classify information. For instance, Amazon uses models to recommend products you’re likely to buy based on your browsing history.

5. Evaluation ✅

No model is complete without testing! The evaluation step assesses how accurate or effective a model is. Imagine creating a weather prediction model – accuracy is crucial to ensure people can rely on it!

6. Deployment & Monitoring 🚀

Finally, we put the model to work. But it doesn’t end there – ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure the model performs well in the real world. For instance, a fraud detection model in banking must be continuously updated to stay ahead of new scam techniques.

As you can see, data science is a fascinating, dynamic field that combines different skills to turn raw data into meaningful insights and solutions. Data science is like detective work 🕵️ – you gather clues (data), clean up the evidence (data cleaning), look for patterns (analysis), and create a profile (model) to solve the case (make decisions)!

By the end of this course, you’ll have hands-on experience with these steps and the knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges.

🤔 However, wouldn't AI Take the Jobs of Data Scientists?
The short answer is no. Let's look at why data scientists will still remain relevant.

1. Human Insight & Problem Definition

AI is powerful but lacks the nuanced understanding that humans bring to defining complex problems. Data scientists not only handle the data but also understand business objectives and identify relevant questions to solve. For example, only a data scientist could help an e-commerce company decide which customer segments to target and what kind of model would be most effective for personalized recommendations.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Anyone who’s spent time in data science knows that data cleaning takes up a huge chunk of the work. AI can assist with certain repetitive tasks, but data preparation requires a level of context and domain expertise. Data scientists understand that certain anomalies could be essential patterns rather than errors.

3. Model Selection and Interpretation

AI can automate the process of choosing and testing models, but interpreting model results is a different story. A data scientist can look at a model’s output and adjust parameters, fine-tune features, or pivot to another approach if the results don’t align with business needs. Interpreting and explaining these results to non-technical teams also requires communication skills that go beyond what AI can offer.

4. Ethics & Bias in Data

AI models learn from data but can also adopt the biases present in it. Data scientists act as “ethical guards,” ensuring that models are fair, transparent, and align with company values. For example, a data scientist can identify and correct a model that inadvertently discriminates against certain demographics, something an AI might overlook entirely.
